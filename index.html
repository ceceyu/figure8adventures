		<div class="benefit-paragraph">
			<p>From deep water solos at The New to the stellar heights of Potrero Chico, we'll guide you to areas that are difficult to experience efficiently on your own. Our staff will hand-pick the best classics and hidden gems for you based on your interest and skill level.</p>
