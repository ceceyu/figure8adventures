<p>We are committed to the safety of our participants as well as the safety and longevity of the beautiful lands that make rock climbing possible. Our guides are certified in technique and wilderness first aid by the American Mountain Guides Association, and 5% of our proceeds go to local environmental and climbing access organizations such as Friends of Muir Valley and The Access Fund. </p>
